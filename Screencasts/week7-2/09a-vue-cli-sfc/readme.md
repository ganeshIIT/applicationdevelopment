# Advanced Vue - SFC, Vue Cli
Welcome to the Modern Application Development - 2 Screencasts. In this screencast we will see how to use setup your computer with tools that are required for building Vue with Single File Components.

- Terminal
- Browser
- Editor


## SFC and others
What are SFC and give an example

### But how to run?
We need a vue-cli to run. What does this vue cli do in this case? It kind compiles/builds this `.vue` into respective js and html files. Which can be served to the customer.

Vue CLI has other uses too. But lets start with the installation and basics of it.

> The CLI assumes prior knowledge of Node.js and the associated build tools. If you are new to Vue or front-end build tools, we strongly suggest going through the guide without any build tools before using the CLI.


So here in the next few steps will install nodejs and build tools to use the Vue CLI. You can also build a Vue app without using any of these advanced Vue features. But the idea here is to show whats possible and to give a kickstart, so you could start on your own path of learning. Hence we will not be going in details of nodejs or npm or other tools. But we will introduce you enouh that you can start do things on your own.

## Install node
- Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- So you could run '.js' files outside the browser and build apps like in any other language.
- The biggest advantage being you use one langauge to build both front end and backend.

`which node`

`node hello-world.js`

## Install npm
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

## Then install the Vue CLI
npm install -g @vue/cli
npm i -g @vue/cli-service-global

## Run the App.vue

## Build the App.vue

## In the next 
In the next one we will create a project and build a project. With modules, other componenets etc.

Also remember. node+javascript is a complete environment to build the APP. You could perhaps build both backend APIs and frontend with node and JS. In this we are going to use the node system only to develop the frontend.
